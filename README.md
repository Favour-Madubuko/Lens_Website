# This is a marketing lens display website
This website displays different shade of glasses for different users. This was inspired as I do wear glasses and was seeking a way to practice my web development skills

## Getting started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project as it has not been hosted. It will basically get you up and running on your local machine for development and testing purpose

### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installing

1. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Favour-Madubuko/Lens_Website
```

2. Install dependencies

```sh
npm install 
```

3. Start the development server

```sh
npm start
```
The website will be running on http://localhost:3000

## Built With
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Node.js

#### Lessons learnt
- I tried using the Simple Lightbox module for picture slides but was not able to achieve it. This taught me to do simple things and go for efficiency.
- I tried hosting using GitHub pages to host but could not achieve it as I intended to add more Javascript funtionality to the website.
- Never to reinvent the wheel. Go for efficiency and fastest way to achieve results rather than coding from scratch

### To DO
- [ ] Add functionality and try converting the website into an E-commerce for eye glasses.
- [ ] Practice clean code practice and review Document Object Model (DOM)
